   Scan through elements of a list.  Similar to List.iter, but the elements
   both before and after the element currently being processed are passed to 
   the lambda function.
    
   e.g., On the list {[ [1;2;3;4] ]} the lambda function would be invoked as...
   
   {[ f [] 1 [2;3;4] ]}
   
   {[ f [1] 2 [3;4] ]}
   
   {[ f [1;2] 3 [4] ]}
   
   {[ f [1;2;3] 4 [] ]}
    
   @param f    The scan function.  On any given invocation of f, l may be 
               reconstructed by concatenating f's three inputs in order.
   @param l    The list to scan over

(** 
   Map the elements of a list in the same manner as scan.  Like 
   ListExtras.scan, but based on List.map instead of List.iter. 
   
   @param f    The map function.  On any given invocation of f, l may be 
               reconstructed by concatenating f's three inputs in order.
   @param l    The list to map over

(** 
   Fold the elements of a list in the sam manner as scan.  Like ListExtras.scan

   @param f    The fold function.  On any given invocation of f, l may be 
               reconstructed by concatenating f's first three inputs in order.  
               The fourth parameter is the most recent fold value.
