==== Release of DBToaster Beta1 ====

The DBToaster team is excited to announce the open beta of the DBToaster SQL query compiler.

DBToaster constitutes a quantum leap in database technology, achieving seemingly impossible performance figures.

The DBToaster compiler generates self-contained main-memory query engines that can be easily embedded into user applications.

At the heart of the DBToaster compiler is a transform that turns SQL queries into code that performs an extremely aggressive form of incremental view maintenance.

Code generated from SQL queries by DBToaster is usually 1000 to 10000 times faster at keeping views fresh than state-of-the-art database and data stream processing systems. Â
