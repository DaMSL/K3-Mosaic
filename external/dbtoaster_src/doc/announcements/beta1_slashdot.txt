==== DBToaster, a Revolution in Query Procesing ====

Researchers from EPFL and Johns Hopkins have released a new tool called <a href="http://www.dbtoaster.org">DBToaster</a> for doing SQL-based query processing (at rates fast enough to challenge claims that SQL is for chumps).  From the website: 

> "DBToaster creates query engines for embedding into applications that require real-time, low-latency data processing and monitoring capabilities.
> ...
> DBToaster-generated code is typically by a factor of 3-4 orders of magnitude faster than existing state of the art data-management systems when we measure the time it takes to refresh a view given an update to the base data."
