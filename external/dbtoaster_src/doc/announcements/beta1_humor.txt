Is your view refresh rate all that it could be?  Is your stream processor frightened by nested aggregate queries?  Do you need query results at the drop of a hat?

Try the new DBToaster Open Beta: 1,000-10,000 faster, and with better SQL support than existing state-of-the-art view maintenance systems.

-------------------------------

The DBToaster compiler generates self-contained query engines that can be easily embedded into user applications.  By analyzing the query workload of each individual user application, DBToaster produces engines custom-tailored to the application's specific data processing needs.  

Database engines produced by DBToaster keep results for the application's query workload fresh and ready for consumption, even if the underlying data is changing rapidly.  For applications like algorithmic trading and realtime analytics, where low-latency responses to rapidly changing data are critical, our experiments show a common-case performance improvement of 3-4 orders of magnitude over state-of-the-art database and data stream processing systems.  

At the heart of the DBToaster compiler is an extreme form of incremental view maintenance that we call the viewlet transform.  Applying the viewlet transform to a query produces a hierarchy of higher order delta views and update rules which dramatically reduce the cost of maintaining materialized views.  In addition to the viewlet transform, DBToaster employs a broad range of programming language and compiler techniques to generate extremely efficient code.
