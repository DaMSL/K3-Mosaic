      the mk-functions automatically eliminate certain redundancies on the

      neg_f to the fold result of e in an expression -e; and

      The only real difference to the function polynomial is that
      products of sums are not turned into sums of products using

      encountered between the two expressions, cmp_exprs will immediately return
      None.  
      
      
      cmp_leaf will be invoked to determine whether two leaves are equivalent
      and should return None if they are not.  Metadata about the comparison
      may be returned if they are equivalent in isolation.
      
      sum_f and prod_f are invoked on values returned by cmp_leaf and should be
      used to ensure that the returned metadata is consistent.  If so, metadata
      regarding the entire sum or product should be returned.      
      
      A positive result (Some(x)) is guaranteed to be an equivalent expr, while
      a negative result (None) only indicates that we were not able to establish

      are not handled properly (yet).

(** For using Ring, there should be no need to read on below.
   The following code implements a ring with some standard operations
   on expressions; there is nothing specific to DBToaster in here.


   Representation invariant:
   * If the value of an expression is zero, it is syntactically represented
   as zero. (We automatically rewrite 0*x=x*0 to 0 and 0+x=x+0 to x.)

   We also always represent 1*x=x*1 as x.

   But we do not internally represent expressions as polynomials, because
   this transformation may produce exponential blow-up. So the function
   for conversion to a polynomial is not a dummy.
