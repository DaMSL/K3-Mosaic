(** 
   A module for computing initialization code for a given expression.
   
   This is required in two cases:
      - When we acccess (on the RHS) a map with a set of input variables that
        we have never encountered before (i.e., we extend the input domain of a
        map).  Note that we will never update a map (i.e., on the LHS) in a way
        that extends its input domain, because the input variables are, by 
        definition, not bound within the defining expression.
      - When we access or update an expression that does not have input 
        variables, but still does not have finite support.  This can only happen
        when the root level of the expression (or one of the terms of a sum 
        at the root level of the expression) is a lift expression (or is the
        product of several lifts).  In this case, there is a finite domain, 
        but elements of the domain have nonzero initial values.
   
   For now, we ignore the case of input variables, as we never generate 
   maps with input variables in the compiler (for now).  Our approach to 
   performing IVC on output-only expressions is based around a reductive 
   approach: For a specific type of IVC (of which there are several, each 
   corresponding to one of the functions defined below), zero out any relations
   which are guaranteed to be empty (or have an empty relevant slice), and then
   propagate the zero as aggressively as possible.
   
   In general, there are three (and a half) cases:
      - The expression has finite support. (no IVC is required)
      - The expression produces a nonzero value for a fixed number of rows.
        This is the case when the value is nonzero (as defined above), and
        all of its output variables are defined either entirely by inlining or
        in a static table. (IVC can be done entirely at startup)
      - The expression produces a nonzero value for an infinite number of rows.
        This is the case when the value is nonzero, and at least one of its 
        output variables receives its domain (at least in part) from a stream.
        (runtime IVC is required).  In this case, however, we might be able to
        limit the set of delta queries for which IVC is actually required.
      - The expression produces a nonzero value for an infinite number of rows,
        but a finite number of these rows are known at startup.  This can happen
        when the domain of a variable is derived from the union of the domain
        of a table/inline expression and a stream (we do as much IVC at
        startup as possible, and then do the rest at runtime)

(**
   Compute the IVC of a given expression for use at startup 

   At startup, all stream relations are guaranteed to be empty.  This makes
   for extremely trivial IVC generation.  We just replace all the stream
   relations with zeroes, do some basic propagation, and we're done.
   
   Of course, we need to make sure that these zeroes get propagated down through
   aggsums.
   
   Before we do this, however, we first determine whether or not we actually
   need to perform IVC at startup.  This falls into the second of the three
   cases.  There are two reasons why we wouldn't do IVC here:
      - The expression's has a zero default value to begin with (in which case 
        we never need to do IVC)
      - One or more of the expression's output variables have a domain which
        is defined entirely by a stream (in which case all IVC must be done at
        runtime).
   
   Note that this IVC expression does not need any materialization.  The only 
   relations it contains are static tables (which have already been individually
   materialized), and there's no performance benefit to be gained by doing any
   piecewise materialization on the expression itself -- The best we can do is
   implement any relevant joins efficiently (which is not something that we're
   able to do in Calculus).

(**
   Determine whether the expression needs runtime IVC (if so, we can't do 
   anything clever to simplify the expression, we just need to materialize a 
   simplified version).
   
   The expression will not need runtime IVC if one of two things is true:
      - The expression's initial value is derived exclusively from stream
        relations. (i.e., stream + stream, but not stream + table, or lift(...))
        In this case, the expression's value will always be zero at init.
      - All of the expression's output variables receive their domains from 
        static (inline or table) sources.  In this case, the expression will 
        have been entirely initialized at system ready.
   
   Because it's simpler, we test for the contrapositive of each case.  We first
   determine if the value has any inline or table influences, and then test if
   any of the expression's output variables have a domain that is influenced by
   a stream relation.
