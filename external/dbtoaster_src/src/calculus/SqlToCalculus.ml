(** 
   This utility function performs conversion from arbitrary calculus expressions
   to values (e.g., so that the expression values can be compared).  It does 
   this by lifting the expression into a newly created variable (if necessary).
   
   Note that introducing a variable necessitates its subsequent removal from the
   scope.  Thus, any expression containing the return value(s) of this function
   must be surrounded by an appropriately grouped AggSum.
   
   Also note that in most cases where this function is used below (conditions 
   and expressions), no new variables/columns will be introduced.  Thus, it is
   safe to just use an AggSum with no group by variables.
   
   It should also be safe to leave these values ungrouped, since they'll get 
   grouped together into the aggsum on the outside.  However, there are a few
   corner cases where a lift can occur outside of an aggregate, so it's better
   to be safe.

   [normalize_agg_target_expr gb_vars expr]
   
   Transform a SQL aggregate expression into a calculus-friendly form.  This 
   entails rewriting the expression so that terms that appear outside of the
   aggregate(s) follow these properties: 
   - Variables appearing outside of the aggregate are all group-by variables.
     (this isn't so much a rewrite as a sanity check, as the SQL expression is
     invalid otherwise).
   - Products of aggregates and non-aggregates have the non-aggregate on the
     right-hand side so that (group-by) variables appearing in the non-aggregate
     terms will be bound by the aggregate
   - A sum/subtraction operation with at least one non-aggregate child must 
     have a parent that is a product with an aggregate (so that the sum will 
     appear on the right hand side and have all variables bound).  At present,
     we will not support sums at the root level (because that makes the default 
     value of the root map something other than zero), although it should be 
     easy to support this once we have support for toplevel queries defined as 
     arbitrary expressions.

   [calc_of_sql_expr ~materialize_query:(...) tables expr]
   
   Translate a SQL expression into a Calculus expression.  The behavior of this
   function differs from the expected in one noticeable way: Aggregate functions
   can not be materialized inline, as they require the full context of the
   query surrounding the aggregate function.
   
   Specifically, consider the query:

   {[SELECT (SUM(x) / (COUNT( * ))) FROM R WHERE y > 0]}

   This query needs two separate aggregates, as it would be translated to:

   {[AggSum(R(x) * [y>0] * x) / AggSum(R(x) * [y>0])]}

   Apart from the elipses, [AggSum(R(x) * [y>0] * ...)] comes entirely from 
   outside of the expression itself.
   
   Thus, [calc_of_sql_expr] takes an optional materialize_query operator, which
   will be invoked at any Aggregate node to materialize the query at that point.
   If the operator is not present when calc_of_sql_expr is called on an 
   expression with Aggregates, an exception will be raised.
   @param materialize_query (optional) An operator to materialize the query when
                            an aggregate function is encountered
   @param tables            The schema of the database on which the query is 
                            being run
   @param sources           The sources of the query in the context of which 
                            [expr] is being evaluated.
   @param expr              A SQL expression
   @return                  The Calculus form of [expr]
   @raise Failure If the SQL expression is invalid (e.g., it contains a nested
                  subquery with >1 target or if it contains an aggregate
                  function where none is expected).
