Instructions
------------
For most purposes, you'll want to run auto_test.rb. To run tests using only simple queries, use the '-s' argument. To run a specific test with more detailed output, add '-n num' where num is the number of a test.

To run sql_test.rb, you provide the path of an SQL file. auto_test.rb can reference each SQL file in the dbtoaster/examples/ directory using only numbers, so it's generally easier to use.

Conversion leaves many files behind to be examined, including temp.k3 (the k3 version of the query), temp.m3 (the m3 version of the query), and temp.err in case of errors.
